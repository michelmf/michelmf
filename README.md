### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Michel here, hope you're doing well!

I hold a bachelor's degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and have experience in software engineering, data science, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, analog/digital electronics, and cybersecurity. 

Currently, all my projects are private because they are messy, outdated, and poorly documented. I will update the repositories as I find time. Hopefully, they will all be complete by 2025!
